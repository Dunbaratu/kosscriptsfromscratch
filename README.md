# kosscriptsfromscratch
For a new kOS game on twitch where I start from nothing and make fresh scripts from scratch.

I intend to do an episode of my twitch stream where I start
from an empty script folder and use nothing from my pre-made
scripts and only make stuff up as we go on the stream.

This repo is to hold the result of doing that.
